# Cartpole-RL-algorithms
Implementation of Reinforcement learning algorithms for Cartpole problem.

1) Cartpole1.py implements Monte Carlo algorithm for discrete state space.

2) Cartpole2.py implements Q-learning algorithm for discrete state space.

3) Cartpole3.py implements Q-learning algorithm in Function approximation setting.

4) Cartpole4.py implem,ents TRPO. It requires my-cartpole2.py file for modified Cartpole environment.

Note: Cartpole1.py, Cartpole2.py, Cartpole3.py requires my-cartpole1.py file for modified Cartpole environment.
